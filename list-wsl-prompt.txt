Write a PowerShell 7 Core script that lists installed WSL distributions in a table.

The table should show:

- Whether the distribution is the default distribution, by reading the DafaultDistribution key at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Lxss. If the distribution name matches the DefaultDistribution key, then the distribution is the default distribution, display an asterisk (*) next to the distribution name. If the distribution is not the default distribution, then do not display an asterisk next to the distribution name.
- The distribution name from the Windows Registry, listed under the heading "WSL Distro Name"
- The distribution PRETTY_NAME, by spawning a process in that respective distribution and reading the distribution's /etc/os-release file for PRETTY_NAME, listed under the heading "Linux Distro Name"
- The distribution's version, by spawning a process in that respective distribution and reading the distribution's /etc/os-release file for VERSION, listed under the heading "Distro Version"
- Whether the distribution has systemd enabled or not, by spawning a process in that respective distribution and reading /etc/wsl.conf for the systemd=true key, listed under the heading "systemd"
- The distribution's default UID, by reading the default UiD key in the Windows Registry, listed under the heading "Default UID"
- The distribution's default username, by spawning a process in that respective distribution, running "id -un -- " followed by the default UID key in the respective WSL distribution, and parsing the output, under the heading "Default User"
- The distribution's state, by reading the State key in the Windows Registry, and listing "Installed" for a value of 0x1, "Installing" for a value of 0x3, or "Uninstalling", for a value of 0x4, under the heading "State"
- The distribution's WSL version as 1 or 2, by reading the Version key in the Windows Registry, listed under the heading "WSL Version"

Additionallly:

- Do not display the distro GUID in the table.
- Do not create a column for default distro, simply append an asterix next to the default distro's name.
- Do not use \\wsl$\ to access the /etc/os-release file or /etc/wsl.conf file.
- Get the /etc/os-release and /etc/wsl.conf files through \AppData\Local\Packages, get them by spawning a process with wsl.exe -d followed by the distribution name then cat each file and parse the output.
- If /etc/wsl.conf is not found, then the distribution does not have systemd enabled.
- Do not check for, display the default username, or default username header if the optional flag --skip-username is passed to the script.
