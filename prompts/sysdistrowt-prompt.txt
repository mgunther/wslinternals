Write a PowerShell 7 Core script that:

Checks for Windows Terminal in $env:LOCALAPPDATA "Packages"

Checks for a settings.json for Windows Terminal in $env:LOCALAPPDATA "Packages"

Checks for Windows Terminal Preview in $env:LOCALAPPDATA "Packages"

Checks for a settings.json for Windows Terminal Preview in $env:LOCALAPPDATA "Packages"

If neither Windows Terminal or Windows Terminal Preview are found, exit with a message that Windows Terminal is not installed.

If Windows Terminal is detected, but no settings.json for Windows Terminal is found, then run and close wt.exe from $env:ProgramFiles Microsoft.WindowsTerminal

If Windows Terminal Preview is detected, but no settings.json for Windows Terminal Preview is found, then run and close wt.exe from $env:ProgramFiles Microsoft.WindowsTerminal

Do not use wildcards to detect files or run wt.exe, parse the directory and use the exact folder name

Add an additional profile called "WSL System Distro" to Windows Terminal if it exists, that launches the WSL system distro with wsl.exe -u root --system

Add an additional profile called "WSL System Distro" to Windows Terminal Preview if it exists, that launches the WSL system distro with wsl.exe -u root --system

Checks if a profile created by the script already exists, and if so, removes the profile
