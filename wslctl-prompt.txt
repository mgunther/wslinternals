Write a PowerShell Core 7 script that:

- checks if it is being run as administrator, and, if not, exists with a message that the script must be run as administrator
- will be run with the argument enable, disable, or restart followed by the name of an installed WSL distro
- if run with the argument enable, disable, or restart, but no WSL distro specified, exits with a message that a WSL distro must be specified
- if run with the argument enable followed by a WSL distro name, checks to see if the WSL distro exists, if it does not exist, it exits with a message the WSL distro not exist, if it does exist, it checks if starting the distro as a task has already been enabled, if it has already been enabled, it exits with a message the WSL distro has already been enabled, finally, if the scheduled task does not exist, it creates and installs a scheduled task in the scheduled task folder \Microsoft\Windows\WSL that starts the WSL distro on startup
- if run with argument disable followed by a WSL distro name, checks to see if a scheduled task has been created in the way enable created the task, if it does not exist, it exits with a message the WSL distro is not enabled, if it does exist, it disables the scheduled task that starts the WSL distro on start and removes the corresponding task folder under Microsoft\WSL
- if run with the argument restart followed by a WSL distro name, checks to see if a scheduled task has been created in the way enable created the task, if it does not exist, it exists with a message the WSL distro is not enabled, if it does exist, it disables the scheduled task that starts the WSL distro on start, re-enables the scheduled task that starts the WSL distro on start, and then runs shutdown -r now as root in the respective distro
- if the distro name specified by the user is Pengwin, then use WLinux as the distro name within the script
- check for the existence of an installed distro by parsing each GUID in HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Lxss for the DistributionName key
- do not use TaskPath with Get-ScheduledTask when checking to see if a WSL distro is enabled, look for the simply task by name, for example: Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName "Start $distroname at startup"
- do not provide a list of commands used
